## Workshop Background

In this workshop, we'll cover the how and why of processing accelerometer data using open-source tools.
Specifically, we'll focus on the popular [`GGIR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/index.html) package.

### Agenda

We will cover:

* The advantages (and some disadvantages) of using open-source processing methods
* The basics of using R
* Installing and running `GGIR`
* Understanding the settings and options
* Interpreting the output
* Common issues and troubleshooting steps
* Advanced options (e.g., day segment analysis)

## Getting Setup

To particpate in the workshop, you'll need three things:

1. R installed on your machine
2. RStudio (or another IDE like VS Code, if you prefer)
3. The example files and scripts

### Install R

We'll be using Version 4.2.x for this workshop, but it should work for versions greater than 4.
If you're running an older version of R, now is a great time to upgrade.

To install R, navigate head to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and follow the instructions to install the version that matches your operating system.

### Install RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - a way to interact with programming languages.
RStudio is specifically designed with R in mind, so it's a great place to start if you have never used R before.

You can install RStudio from [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
Again, just follow the install steps they provide to get started.

### Download Workshop Files

I've provided some example data files and scripts to use during the workshop.
To download these: 

1. Head to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Motivation-and-Behaviour/accel-processing-workshop)
2. Click `Code` then `Download ZIP`

3. Unzip the files. You will only need the `Workshop Files` folder.
