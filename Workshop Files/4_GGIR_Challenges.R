# These are some optional challenges to attempt to get more familiar with GGIR.
# You don't have to do them all, or do them in order.

# Challenge 1:
# There are a set of actigraph files in the data folder.
# Try running GGIR on them.

# Challenge 2:
# Find a different set of cut-points and implement them.

# Challenge 3:
# Recreate the intensity levels bar plot from the presentation, using the data we processed.
# You could do this in Excel, or try it in R.

# Challenge 4:
# Try setting up a mock activity log and processing it.
# Remember that the dates and IDs will need to match
