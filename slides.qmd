## Overview of the workshop

### Objectives

* Understand why open-source methods matter
* Have a basic understanding of R
* Understand how to process accelerometer data with GGIR, and interpret the output

. . .

### Agenda

* The advantages (and some disadvantages) of using open-source processing methods
* The basics of using R
* Installing and running `GGIR`
* Understanding the settings and options
* Interpreting the output
* Common issues and troubleshooting steps
* Advanced options (e.g., day segment analysis)

# Understanding Accelerometer Data and the Need for GGIR {background="#3C1053"}

## Basics of accelerometer data

- What is accelerometer data?
- Common use cases

## Limitations of proprietary methods

- Lack of customization
- Limited transparency
- Vendor lock-in


## Benefits of using GGIR

- Open-source nature
- Customizability
- Comprehensive analysis tools


## Activity: Group discussion

Share your experiences with accelerometer data and proprietary methods

## What is R?

* R is a free, open-source programming language
* Specially designed for data analysis and statistics
* Widely used in research, data science, and industry

### An example

Fitting a simple linear model:

$$\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$$

. . .

**R Code**

```{r}
# Fit a linear model
lm(y ~ x)
```

. . .

**Python Code**

```{.python}
# Import packages
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Add a constant term to x (statsmodels doesn't add one by default)
x = sm.add_constant(x)

# Fit the linear model
model = sm.OLS(y, x).fit()
```

## Why use R?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Pros

* Free
* Reproducible
* Extensive set of add-on tools and packages
* Typeset as you go

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Cons

* Steeper learning curve than point-and-click interfaces
