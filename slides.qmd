## Before We Start

Please go to [bit.ly/GGIRWorkshop](https://bit.ly/GGIRWorkshop) and follow the *Getting Started* instructions.

# Introduction  {background="#3C1053"}

## Why Me?

* More than a decade working with accelerometers
* Projects with >25k accelerometers
* Contributed code to `GGIR`

## Overview of the workshop  {.smaller}

### Objectives

* Understand why open-source methods matter
* Have a basic understanding of R
* Understand how to process accelerometer data with GGIR, and interpret the output

### Agenda

* The advantages (and some disadvantages) of using open-source processing methods
* The basics of using R
* Installing and running `GGIR`
* Understanding the settings and options
* Interpreting the output
* Common issues and troubleshooting steps
* Advanced options (e.g., day segment analysis)

## Limitations of proprietary methods

* Limited transparency
* Limited scalability
* Limited extensability
* Vendor lock-in

## Benefits of using GGIR

* Multi-device
* New and expanding features
* Open-source nature
* Scalable and extensible

# A (Very) Quick Intro to R {background="#3C1053"}

## What is R?

* R is a free, open-source programming language
* Specially designed for data analysis and statistics
* Widely used in research, data science, and industry

## An example

Fitting a simple linear model:

$$\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$$

. . .

**R Code**

```{r}
# Fit a linear model
lm(y ~ x)
```

. . .

**Python Code**

```{.python}
# Import packages
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Add a constant term to x (statsmodels doesn't add one by default)
x = sm.add_constant(x)

# Fit the linear model
model = sm.OLS(y, x).fit()
```

## Why use R?

### Pros

* Free
* Reproducible
* Extensive set of add-on tools and packages
* Typeset as you go

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Cons

* Steeper learning curve than point-and-click interfaces
